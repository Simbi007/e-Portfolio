									<h3 class="major">Learning Objectives</h3>
									<p> For this module I have learned how to:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Assess the professional, legal, social, cultural, and ethical factors that influence the work of computing professionals.</li>
										<li>Understand and apply the principles of academic research to investigate a topic within the field of computing.</li>
										<li>Analyze and critique existing literature, research methods, and data analysis techniques related to the chosen topic.</li>
										<li>Develop and critically review a research proposal for the selected topic.</li>
                    
									</ul>

									<h3 class="major">Artefacts and Reflections</h3>
									<p> I completed a series of formative exercises and assignments over the Research Methods and Professional Practice Module. Please click the link to view the artifacts of this module<a href="https://github.com/Simbi007/e-Portfolio/tree/main/The%20Docs"class="special">here</a></p>
									                
											<ul>

												<li>In Unit 1 I learned about the ethical issues involved in research and professional practices, as well as the difference between Inductive and Deductive reasoning. I also completed a Reflective Activity on the topic of Ethics in Computing.</li>
			
											
											        <li>In Unit 2 I learned how to formulate Research Questions and how to perform and present a Literature Review. In Unit 3 I was introduced to the topic of Research Design, where I learned that there is Exploratory and Descriptive research design. I also learned about the various data collection methods applicable in Qualitative, mixed, and Quantitative research.</li>
											
												<li>In Unit 4 I learned in more detail how to use case studies, focus groups, and observation as methods of data collection, as well as how to decide which method would be most suitable for a specific research. In Unit 5 I learned about interview, questionnaire, and survey methods, as well as how to use pre-and post-testing in research. I completed a Reflective Activity on the inappropriate use of Surveys in this unit.</li>
											
												<li>In Unit 6 I reviewed descriptive and inferential statistics in data analysis. In Unit 7 I completed formative exercises such as Hypothesis Testing in MS Excel and how to interpret Summary Measures. In Unit 8 I completed a Worksheet on Inference Statistics and I also learned Data Analysis and Visualisation Methods.</li>
												<li>In Unit 9 I completed the Worksheet on using Charts in MS Excel for data visualization as well as how to analyze data to answer a research question. In Unit 10 I completed my Research Proposal Presentation on the topic “Machine Learning Tools and Techniques in Crime Prediction” using MS PowerPoint. I also learned about Research Writing and how to structure a dissertation.</li>
												<li>In Unit 12 I studied how to manage a project, control risk as well as which technologies can be incorporated to support remote collaboration on projects.</li>

											<h3 class="major">Professional Skills Matrix and Action Plan</h3>
											<p> I have gained and improved several valuable Research skills and Professional Practices from this module.  </p> 
									 <ul>
										<li>Data Visualization with Tableau.</li>
										<li>Programming Skills (R).</li> 
										 <li>Statistical Analysis .</li> 
							
									 </ul>
											<p> I can apply these skills at my workplace in  visualization tasks for improved decision-making. However, I still need to improve upon  Statistical Analysis  as this is an essential skill for a Data Scientist. </p>
